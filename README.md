## This is a moded Version...
### and actually under construction!

## To-Do's:

- [ ] Remove all Monochrome Display parts 

  -> Only support for ssd1351 (in progress)

  -> maybe support other (bigger) colour-Displays later
  
- [ ] Support for Album-Art from Volumio-API
  
  -> Think this will be a key element:[https://github.com/Bodmer/TJpg_Decoder](https://github.com/Bodmer/TJpg_Decoder)

- [ ] Multiple Layouts
  
  -> selectable in Menu

- [ ] Support for "Status-LED's"

- [ ] Preconfiguration for (touch-) Button-Functions (play, pause, next...)

- [ ] Maybe a Preconfiguration-script for PC

  -> Like the install.sh of NR1-UI

- [ ] Fill the Wiki

  -> Installation instructions

  -> Config- HowTo's

  -> etc.

## Allready done:

- [x] added File-Format, Samplerate and Bitdepth to Main-Screen
- [x] added a seccond "Main-Screen" which changes every x seconds
